vowpalwabbit.pyvw.pylibvw
=========================

The Python bindings employ native bindings and then inherit from this in Python
to add extra functionality. The classes on this page should not be directly
instantiated. The types in `vowpalwabbit.pyvw` should be used instead. A better
way to structure this would be composition so that the methods are properly
documented compared to this two definition situation.

.. autoclass:: vowpalwabbit.pyvw.pylibvw.vw
