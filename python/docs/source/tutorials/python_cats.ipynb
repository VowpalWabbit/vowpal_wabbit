If the learner recommends a temperature that aligns with the reward function, we give a positive reward. Max reward is -1.0, min reward is 0 since VW learns in terms of cost, so we return a negative reward. In our simulated world this is the difference between the temperature recommended and the temperature chosen. If the difference is smaller than 5 degrees then we give a reward to the thermostat.

    "We will try all the number of actions as powers of 2 from 8 until 2048. Since our continuous range stays the same (0-32) we are creating smaller range buckets as the number of actions grows. The number of actions needs to be a power of 2 as it represents the number of leaves that the internal binary tree will have. Small number of actions might result in coarser discretizaton leading to results similar to uniform random. On the other hand really large number of actions could mean that we need a lot more data in order to train all of the buckets.\n",
