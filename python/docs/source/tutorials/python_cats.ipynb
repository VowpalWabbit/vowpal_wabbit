If the learner recommends a temperature that aligns with the reward function, we give a positive reward. Max reward is -1.0, min reward is 0 since VW learns in terms of cost, so we return a negative reward. In our simulated world this is the difference between the temperature recommended and the temperature chosen. If the difference is smaller than 5 degrees then we give a reward to the thermostat.

The number of actions needs to be a power of 2 as it represents the number of leaves that the internal binary tree will have. Small number of actions might result in coarser discretizaton leading to results similar to uniform random. On the other hand really large number of actions could mean that we need a lot more data in order to train all of the buckets.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also try all the combinaitons of the above action numbers with bandwidths ranging from 0 to 25. The smaller the bandwidth the smaller the smoothing range around the selected continuous value. Really large bandwidths will result in large smoothing ranges and could lead to results similar to uniform random."
