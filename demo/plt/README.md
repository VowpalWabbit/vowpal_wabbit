Probabilistic Label Tree demo
-------------------------------

This demo presents PLT for applications of logarithmic time multilabel classification.
It uses Mediamill dataset from the [LIBLINEAR datasets repository](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/multilabel.html)
and RCV1-2K, Eurlex-4K, AmazonCat-13K, and Wiki10-31K datasets from the [Extreme Multi-Label (XML) repository](http://manikvarma.org/downloads/XC/XMLRepository.html) 
converted to Vowpal Wabbit format using scripts from [this repository](https://github.com/mwydmuch/datasets4vw).
`plt_demo.py` script trains PLT model, and test prediction with threshold = 0.5 as well as top-5 prediction.
The datasets and paremeters can be easliy edited in the script. The script require VW, Python and wget installed.


## PLT options
```
--plt                       Probabilistic Label Tree with <k> labels
--kary_tree                 use <k>-ary tree. By default = 2 (binary tree)
--threshold                 predict labels with conditional marginal probability greater than <thr> threshold"     
--top_k                     predict top-<k> labels instead of labels above threshold                 
```

## Tips for using PLT
PLT accelerates training and prediction for a large number of classes, 
if you have less than 10000 classes, you should probably use OAA.
If you have a huge number of labels and features at the same time, 
you will need as many bits (`-b`) as can afford computationally for the best performance.
You may also consider using `--sgd` instead of default adaptive, normalized, and invariant updates to 
gain more memory for feature weights what may lead to better performance.
You may also consider using `--holdout_off` if you have many rare labels in your data.
